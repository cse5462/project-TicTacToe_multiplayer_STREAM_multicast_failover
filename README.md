## TicTacToe Server
> By: Conner Graham

### DESCRIPTION <a name="description-server"></a>
This lab contains a program called "tictactoeServer" which sets up
multiple net-enabled TicTacToe games that clients can play simultaneously.
This server sets up a communication endpoint for other players to communicate
with, initializes a set of game boards, and processes any commands received
from other players. These commands can include initializing a game of TicTacToe
when a player requests one, responding to other player's moves until a
winner is found or the game is a draw, or ending a game of TicTacToe when a player
requests to. If a player leaves the game (i.e. closes the connection) the game is
reset for another player to play.
The specific tasks the server performs are as follows:
- Create and bind server socket from user provided port
- Print server info and listen for client connections
- Initialize all game boards
- Accept TCP STREAM connections from waiting clients
- Process the command for the corresponding game

If the number of arguments is incorrect or the remote port is
invalid, the program prints appropriate messages and shows how to
correctly invoke the program. 

### USAGE <a name="usage-server"></a>
Start the TicTacToe P1 Server with the command...
```sh
$ tictactoeServer <local-port>
```

If any of the argument strings contain whitespace, those
arguments will need to be enclosed in quotes.

### ASSUMPTIONS <a name="assumptions-server"></a>
- It is assumed that the Player 1 (server) will terminate the server
  when they are done playing, in which case clients will need to
  find another serevr to connect to if they sich to play.
- It is assumed that the client will never enter the int -1 (char '/')
  for a move as it is being used as an error code.
- It is assumed that messages with a sequence number that has already
  been processed will be ingnored.
- It is assumed that messages with a sequence number above the current
  number are an error and the game will be reset.

## TicTacToe Client
> By: Ben Nagel

### DESCRIPTION <a name="description-client"></a>
This lab contains a program called "tictactoeClient" which creates and sets up a 5 byte transfer protocal client. This client connects to the specified server( IP address and port). Next,this client sends 5 bytes of data to the specified server( IP address and port) and then reads in 5 bytes of data from the server. This process continues until a winner or a tie has been reached.

The specific tasks the client performs are as
follows:
- Connect to the Server
- Create server socket from user provided IP/port
- Send Stream Socket connection requests to the server
- Process recieved data
- Terminate the connection to the server

### USAGE <a name="usage-client"></a>
Start the TicTacToe P2 Client with the command...
```sh
$ tictactoeClient  <local-port> <remote-IP>
```

If any of the argument strings contain whitespace, those
arguments will need to be enclosed in quotes.

### ASSUMPTIONS <a name="assumptions-client"></a>
- Client send and recieves a 5 bytes 
- The spaces on the tictactoe board are 1-9
- Player 1 is the "server": they are the one who calls bind()   
- Player 1 goes first
- On any errors, close the connection 
- It is assumed that the IP addresses 0.0.0.0 and 255.255.255.255 are invalid remote server addresses to connect to as they are reserved values.
